I will explain how my fortnite skin trivia website works here!

DESCRIPTION
My website is a trivia game about OG Fortnite skins. It is a 10 question multiple choice trivia game. The user is asked a question about a certain skin, then they have to select what skin that question is asking about. The game tracks the score of the user and displays it at the end. It tests the OG Fortnite skin ball knowledge of the user.

HOW TO USE
The user chooses reads the questions and picks whichever answer they think is correct. They get a message either saying they are correct, or saying they are wrong then they are told what the right answer was. You can click the about which will forward you to information about what the game is. After answering all questions the users final score will be given to them. You don't have to type anything, just click on the correct answer.

FILES
Images folder contain all of the images I have. The images are jpg.
Readme.md has an explanation of my code and how to use it.
About.html describes to the user what the reason for the website is.
Index.html makes the webpage and what is on it, like images.
Script.js has all of the buttons and the questions. Calculates total score.
Styles.css 

CREDIBILITY
Luke Calvin Helped me come out with some of the questions and skins that I used.
AI helped me with making a tracker for what question the user was on. It debugged shuffling the questions so they were not always in the same order. It helped with fixing the final score after shuffling the questions. AI was mainly used for debugging, not making code.
