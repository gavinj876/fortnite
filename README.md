DESCRIPTION

My website is a trivia game about OG Fortnite skins. It is a 10 question multiple choice trivia game. The user is asked a question about a certain skin, then they have to select what skin that question is asking about. The game tracks the score of the user and displays it at the end. It tests the OG Fortnite skin ball knowledge of the user.

HOW TO USE

The user reads the questions and picks whichever answer they think is correct. They get a message either saying they are correct, or saying they are wrong, then they are told what the right answer was. The user is displayed what question they are on. You can click the about which will forward you to information about what the game is and the reason for it. After answering all questions the users final score will be given to them. You don't have to type anything, just click on the correct answer.
