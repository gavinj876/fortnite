# FORTNITE
## IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE WEBSITE OR CODE, WE CAN TALK OFFLINE AND FURTHER DEBUG THE ISSUE WITH JAIME

My name is Gavin Johnson, I created this fortnite skin themed trivia for my APCSP final website project.
[OG Fortnite Skin Trivia](https://gavinj876.github.io/fortnite/)

DESCRIPTION

My website is a trivia game about OG Fortnite skins. It is a 10 question multiple choice trivia game. The user is asked a question about a certain skin, then they have to select what skin that question is asking about. The game tracks the score of the user and displays it at the end. It always shuffles the order of questions and what order the answer are in whenever a new user plays. There are 3 different fortnite related images. 1 on the normal trivia, 1 on the about page, and 1 on the end screen. There is the fortnite logo as the background. It tests the OG Fortnite skin ball knowledge of the user.

HOW TO USE

The user reads the questions and picks whichever answer they think is correct. They get a message either saying they are correct, or saying they are wrong, then they are told what the right answer was. The user get to see an image of the fortnite logo and vbucks. The user is displayed what question they are on. You can click the "ABOUT" which will forward you to information about what the game is and the reason for it, there is an image of fishstick there. You can then press back to game to go back to the trivia. After answering all questions the users final score will be given to them. Then you get to see an image of the default skin. You don't have to type anything, just click on the correct answer and test your OG Fortnite skin ball knowledge.

CREDIBILITY

Luke Calvin Helped me come up with some of the questions and skins that I used.

AI helped me make the default skin image only appear at then end of the trivia by telling me what syntax to use and what type of image. It debugged the function that shuffled the questions and answers, so the trivia would not always be in the same order. It helped me debug the background to not overlay the questions. I used it to make sure the background image fit properly. AI gave me types of styles I could use to make the images and website look better.
