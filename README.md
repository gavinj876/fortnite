I will explain how my fortnite skin trivia website works here!

My website is a trivia game about OG Fortnite skins. It is a multiple choice trivia game. The user is asked a question about a certain skin, then they have to select what skin that question is asking about. It tests the OG Fortnite skin ball knowledge of the user.

The website shows the user what question they are on and displays how many they got right when they finish the trivia.
