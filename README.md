# FORTNITE
## IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE WEBSITE OR CODE, WE CAN TALK OFFLINE AND FURTHER DEBUG THE ISSUE WITH JAIME

My name is Gavin Johnson, I created this Fortnite skin-themed trivia for my APCSP final website project.
[OG Fortnite Skin Trivia](https://gavinj876.github.io/fortnite/)

DESCRIPTION

My website is a trivia game about OG Fortnite skins. It is a 10-question multiple-choice trivia game. The user is asked a question about a certain skin, then they have to select the skin that the question is asking about. The game tracks the user's score and displays it at the end. It always shuffles the order of questions and what order the answers are whenever a new user plays. There are 3 different Fortnite-related images. 1 on the normal trivia, 1 on the about page, and 1 on the end screen. There is the Fortnite logo as the background. It tests the OG Fortnite skin ball knowledge of the user.

HOW TO USE

The user reads the questions and picks whichever answer they think is correct. They get a message either saying they are correct or saying they are wrong, then they are told what the right answer was. The user gets to see an image of the Fortnite logo and V-Bucks. The user is displayed what question they are on. You can click the "ABOUT" which will forward you to information about what the game is and the reason for it, and there is an image of a fishstick there. You can then press back to the game to go back to the trivia. After answering all questions, the user's final score will be given to them. Then you get to see an image of the default skin. You don't have to type anything, just click on the correct answer and test your OG Fortnite skin ball knowledge.

The images folder contains all of the images I have. The images are JPG. Skin is the default skin. Fortnite is the logo. Buck is the vbucks. Fish is a fish stick.
Readme.md has an explanation of my code and how to use it.
About.html describes to the user the reason for the website. Shows an image of a fish stick. Button to go back to trivia.
Index.html makes the webpage and what is on it, like images. Button to go to the about page.
Script.js has all of the buttons and the questions. Calculates total score. Shuffles questions and answers.
Styles.css has all of the IDs for specific styles like fonts and colors, so I don't have to type every time.

CREDIBILITY

Luke Calvin helped me come up with some of the questions and skins that I used.

AI helped me make the default skin image only appear at the end of the trivia by telling me what syntax to use. It debugged the function that shuffled the questions and answers, so the trivia would not always be in the same order. It helped me debug the background to overlay the questions. I used it to make sure the background image fit properly. AI gave me types of styles I could use to make the images and website look better.

I used Grammarly to make sure my spelling was good for the readme.

I used vsstudios style50 to make sure I indented correctly with all of my code.
