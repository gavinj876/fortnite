        <h2 id=question>INSANE Fortnite skin Trivia! Try to get 10 out of 10 correct. Most questions are about OG skins. People who played in season 1 will have a easier time. If you played Fortnite you will still be able to get some right. The more Fortnite experience the better.</h2>

        <h2 id=question>YOU NEED INSANE FORTNITE BALL KNOWLEGE TO GET 100%.</h2>

        <h3 id=question>If needed we can talk OFFLINE about the trivia or maybe do some debugging with Jaime about the code.</h3>
